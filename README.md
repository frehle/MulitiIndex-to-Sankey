# MulitiIndex-to-Sankey-to-MFA
This repository includes scripts to process the Statistics Canada Physical flow accounts for plastic material (PFAPM) data sets, to plot a selection of it in a Sanky diagram. The libraries used are pandas and plotly. The language is Python in a Jupyter notebook format.

The "Tutorial" folder includes two Jupyter notebooks; one to process the PFAPM data set by resin, one to process the PFAPM data set by product category. This is the most up-to-date version of the code to plot the data in a Sankey diagram. All the additional files used in the script are stored in the sub-folder "files".

The "in progress" folder contains previous versions of the code, where data set processing in pandas data frames (multiindex) is still separeted from the plotly Sankey plot. The "resin" scrips are operational, the "product_category" scripts a outdated.
