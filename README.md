# MulitiIndex-to-Sankey-to-MFA
This code starts with the Statistics Canada Physical flow accounts for plastic material (PFAPM) in a pandas dataframe.
The two main datasets (by resin and by product category) are plotted separately in varying levels of detail.
It is transformed and plotted in a Sankey which serves as the foundation for the MFA of plastics in Canada.
