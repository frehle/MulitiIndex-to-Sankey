# MulitiIndex-to-Sankey-to-MFA
This code starts with the Statistics Canada Physical flow accounts for plastic material (PFAPM) in a pandas dataframe.
The two main datasets (by resin and by product category) are plotted separately in varying levels of detail.
It is transformed and plotted in a Sankey which serves as the foundation for a MFA of plastics in Canada.
The Tutorial includes two Jupyter notebooks, as well as some relvant additional files, that can do the basic processeing of the two data sets to simplify and plot the data in a Sankey diagram.
